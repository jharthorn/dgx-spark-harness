# Legacy Archive

This directory contains prior v3.3 harness implementations that were removed from primary repo paths during the bench-workflow cleanup.

Contents are preserved for historical reference and diffability only.

- `legacy/docs`: v3.3 plans/checklists/playbooks.
- `legacy/runs`: H0-H9 runner scripts.
- `legacy/src`: old loadgen and telemetry code.
- `legacy/analysis`: old result processors.
- `legacy/configs`: old stack configs.
- `legacy/scripts`: old helper scripts.
- `legacy/root`: old root-level launch scripts.

The active workflow is now:

- `RUNBOOK.md`
- `bench/`
- `scripts/bench_*.sh`
