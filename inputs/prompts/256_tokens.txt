The transition to a renewable-powered global economy is redefining industrial competitiveness. Historically, manufacturing strength was tied to fossil fuel proximity. Today, it's increasingly linked to renewable energy potential and the financial stability to develop it. This study introduces the "Renewable Pull," an economic force driving energy-intensive industries toward regions with lower-cost renewable power.
We analyze ten leading manufacturing nations (China, India, USA, Germany, etc.) to see if they can compete in this new landscape. Our model integrates industrial production directly into each nation's optimized renewable grid, forcing them to compete for the same wind and solar resources. We define the Renewable Pull as the cost advantage of importing goods over producing them domestically.
Results show nine of ten nations face a pull. Japan, South Korea, and Germany are most exposed due to land constraints. However, when national capital costs are included, Germany's low-risk financial environment dramatically reduces its pull, while India's high-risk environment amplifies it. This proves financial stability can be as important as resource potential.
