In the emerging global economy shaped by decarbonization, industrial competitiveness is increasingly defined by access to low-cost renewable energy and the capital to build it. The "Renewable Pull" is a new economic force: the tendency for energy-intensive production to relocate to regions with superior renewable resources and financial conditions. This study quantifies this effect across the world’s ten leading manufacturing nations, including China, India, the United States, and Germany.
Our model evaluates four key commodities: olefins, ammonia, steel, and cement. We embed their production directly into each nation’s optimized renewable energy system, forcing industry to compete with domestic demand for wind and solar power. The Renewable Pull is calculated as the cost ratio of importing versus domestic production. A positive value means imports are cheaper, signaling a risk of industrial relocation.
Nine of ten nations face a positive Renewable Pull. Japan and South Korea are most vulnerable due to limited land and high costs. However, the study's key finding emerges when national capital costs are applied. Germany's stable, low-risk financial system reduces its pull by a factor of six, making it highly competitive despite moderate renewable potential. Conversely, India and Iran, despite strong resources, see their pull increase by over eight times due to high financing costs and hazard risk.
This demonstrates that financial geography is as critical as physical geography. The study also explores mitigation strategies for Germany, finding that importing intermediates like hydrogen and methanol from within the EU can almost entirely neutralize the pull. This suggests a future of specialized, integrated supply chains rather than simple relocation.
A final analysis shows this pull is already visible. The 2023 electricity price gap between Germany (>100 EUR/MWh) and the U.S. (<50 EUR/MWh) implies a pull factor greater than 0.9, meaning fossil-fuel volatility is already creating the same pressures as the future renewable landscape. The conclusion is that competitiveness in a net-zero world will hinge as much on the cost of money as on the cost of sunlight.
