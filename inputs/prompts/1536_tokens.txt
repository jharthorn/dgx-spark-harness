In the unfolding century of decarbonization, the fundamental determinants of industrial competitiveness are being rewritten. For more than a hundred years, heavy industry flourished wherever coal, oil, and natural gas were abundant or easily transported. These fossil-based advantages created entire regional economies whose productivity was inseparable from energy access. Yet as the world accelerates toward climate neutrality, the gravitational center of industry is beginning to shift. Renewable resources—sunlight, wind, and the capital required to harness them—are not distributed evenly, and their unevenness introduces a new vector of economic motion. The concept that describes this motion is the Renewable Pull: the tendency of energy-intensive production to relocate toward regions endowed with cheaper renewable energy or superior financing conditions.
The Renewable Pull is not merely a metaphor. It can be quantified, simulated, and mapped. The present analysis approaches it with the rigor of systems engineering and the perspective of global economics. Its authors constructed a comprehensive model linking industrial process thermodynamics to national-scale renewable energy systems. The goal was to answer a deceptively simple question: can the world’s dominant manufacturing nations—those whose industrial output defines global supply chains—remain competitive when the cost structure of energy is reshaped by renewables? The question reaches far beyond energy policy. It touches employment, trade, technology transfer, and the geographic logic of globalization itself.
To explore this question, ten manufacturing nations were selected: China, India, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Iran. They represent the spectrum of industrial maturity, from hydrocarbon-based exporters to densely populated importers of raw materials. Four benchmark commodities—olefins, ammonia, steel, and cement—were analyzed because together they account for the bulk of global industrial energy demand and form the base of virtually every value chain. Each commodity embodies a distinct combination of chemistry, process heat, and transport intensity. Olefins require massive inputs of hydrogen and electricity; ammonia depends on electrolysis and nitrogen separation; steel demands high-temperature reduction reactions; and cement couples thermal decomposition with carbon capture. By encompassing this range, the study captures the heterogeneity of industrial exposure to energy costs.
The modeling approach departs from previous literature by integrating industry directly into each country’s renewable energy optimization rather than treating it as an external load. Every national model solves for the least-cost configuration of renewable generation, storage, and conversion technologies that can simultaneously meet household, commercial, and industrial electricity demand. Wind, solar, and storage assets are parameterized using high-resolution potential data derived from spatial eligibility analyses. Each country’s system includes onshore and offshore wind, open-field photovoltaic clusters, battery storage, hydrogen vessels, and, where geology permits, salt cavern storage. These salt caverns are crucial because they provide low-cost seasonal buffering of hydrogen and thus strongly influence system flexibility.
Industrial production is co-optimized within this same framework. For each process—methanol synthesis, ammonia production, direct-reduced iron, and clinker formation—specific electricity and feedstock requirements are modeled, including electrolysis efficiency, compression energy, and process heat demand. Hydrogen consumption is tied to the national hydrogen balance, meaning that excess renewable electricity can be used to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which is then stored or used in industrial reactions. The combination of hourly renewable time series and annual production constraints ensures that the model captures both the diurnal variability of renewables and the continuous nature of industrial operation.
At the economic level, every asset carries an investment cost, fixed and variable operating costs, and a capital recovery factor defined by a discount rate. Two scenarios govern these rates. The first assumes a uniform global discount rate, representing a world of equal financing conditions. The second assigns each country a national capital cost derived from financial market data and adjusted for projected natural hazard risk. This adjustment accounts for the fact that physical and climate risks raise borrowing costs by increasing insurance premiums and investor risk perception. The introduction of natural hazard–adjusted capital costs adds a layer of realism absent from previous global studies.
Transport and trade are modeled explicitly. For each pair of export and import countries, shipping costs are calculated using route simulations based on port location, vessel type, and canal tolls. Investment, maintenance, labor, insurance, and port fees are incorporated into the cost of maritime transport. Products are assumed to move in bulk form: olefins as methanol, steel as hot briquetted iron, ammonia as liquid cargo, and cement as granular solid. Shipping costs are relatively small for high-value chemicals but substantial for heavy, low-value materials such as cement, which naturally limits long-distance trade in the latter.
From these calculations, a Renewable Pull value is derived. Mathematically, it is the ratio of domestic production cost to import cost minus one. A positive value means imports are cheaper, implying a pull on domestic industry. Two additional indicators summarize the distribution of pull values: REP₍₂₀₎, the threshold exceeded by the twenty cheapest exporters, and REPₘₐₓ, the strongest single pull experienced by an importing country. These metrics allow differentiation between widespread mild exposure and concentrated extreme vulnerability.
Results show striking patterns. Under uniform capital costs, nine of the ten top manufacturing nations experience a positive Renewable Pull for at least one of the modeled commodities. Only Saudi Arabia, endowed with vast renewable potential and abundant land, remains essentially immune. The magnitude of the pull aligns closely with each nation’s geography. Japan and South Korea exhibit the highest exposure, constrained by mountainous terrain and limited land availability for renewables. Both rely heavily on costly offshore wind and lack salt cavern storage, forcing dependence on hydrogen vessels. Germany follows closely, affected by limited onshore wind potential and moderate solar irradiance. India’s exposure arises from weak wind resources rather than land scarcity, while China’s vast area and resource diversity partially buffer it but do not eliminate regional deficits.
The nature of the product also matters. Olefin production shows the largest Renewable Pull values, often exceeding 0.6, because its production cost is dominated by renewable electricity and hydrogen. Transport adds only a few percent to import cost, making distance almost irrelevant. Ammonia follows a similar pattern, while steel exhibits intermediate sensitivity: shipping hot briquetted iron adds about ten percent to delivered cost, which mitigates but does not remove the pull. Cement behaves differently. Its low energy share and high transport cost cancel each other, producing negligible Renewable Pull values in most cases. In effect, the global cement industry remains locally anchored even in a fully renewable world.
When national capital costs are applied, the map of competitiveness changes dramatically. Germany, initially in the upper mid-range, becomes the second least affected nation after Saudi Arabia. Its low discount rate—reflecting political stability, deep financial markets, and minimal hazard risk—offsets its moderate renewable potential. The Renewable Pull on Germany decreases by roughly a factor of six. Conversely, Iran and India experience surges in pull intensity, in some cases by factors of eight or more, as high financing costs and hazard exposure inflate capital recovery charges. Japan and South Korea remain vulnerable due to the combination of high construction costs and limited domestic storage. China’s exposure rises modestly, revealing that its capital market conditions only partly compensate for renewable resource variability.
Geographically resolved maps highlight where each nation feels the strongest pull. Germany faces competition primarily from North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Qatar, Kuwait, and Namibia rank among the most cost-competitive exporters, with Renewable Pull values around 0.3 to 0.4. Additional pressure originates from Mauritania, Norway, Denmark, and Uruguay, all below 0.2. The United States experiences similar pulls from Western Sahara, Mauritania, and Namibia, with lesser influences from Portugal and Kazakhstan. China’s exposure is broader: seventy-two countries exert measurable pull, with values approaching 0.9 from Qatar and 0.75 from Kuwait. India’s case is even more extreme—ninety-seven countries exert pull, with some values exceeding 1.3, meaning imports could be less than half the domestic production cost.
Transport costs partially moderate these dynamics. In olefin production, where total costs reach two to three thousand euros per ton, shipping rarely contributes more than four percent, making geography nearly irrelevant. In steel, transport offsets about thirteen percent of the pull, while in cement, it can exceed the production cost differential entirely, explaining the near absence of Renewable Pull. Thus, the relative share of transport cost to production cost acts as a natural shield for bulk commodities.
The study then examines how strategic imports can counteract the Renewable Pull. Germany is used as the exemplar because of its advanced industrial base and constrained renewable potential. Three intermediates are analyzed: hydrogen, methanol, and hot briquetted iron. The import model compares global maritime supply with intra-European pipeline and truck delivery. When import infrastructure is optimized jointly with domestic production, Germany’s Renewable Pull nearly disappears. For olefin and ammonia production, importing methanol or hydrogen from EU partners yields cost parity with low-cost global exporters. In the steel sector, importing hot briquetted iron almost eliminates the pull but sacrifices primary ironmaking capacity, while hydrogen imports reduce it substantially while retaining domestic value creation. Across all scenarios, intra-EU logistics outperform global shipping due to lower distances and regulatory harmonization.
The implications extend beyond simple cost optimization. Imports relieve the domestic power system by reducing the electricity required for electrolysis and process heat. This relief has quantifiable economic value: a 200 terawatt-hour increase in industrial electricity demand raises overall production cost by roughly eighteen percent, while an equivalent decrease lowers it by six percent. Thus, targeted imports act as a valve, stabilizing national energy systems and mitigating price volatility. They also provide flexibility against fluctuations in capital cost. Should Germany’s financing conditions worsen, the cost-optimal model would automatically shift toward greater reliance on imported intermediates, preserving competitiveness without radical policy intervention.
Discussion of sensitivities reveals that four factors dominate the Renewable Pull: renewable resource quality, storage potential, capital costs, and logistics. Of these, capital cost heterogeneity is the most potent. If global capital markets were to converge, nations like Iran, India, Russia, and Brazil would experience the largest competitiveness gains, while Germany’s relative advantage would erode. Conversely, increasing financial risk—whether from economic instability or climate hazards—could intensify the pull on developing economies and trigger industrial relocation even in advance of technological parity.
A complementary experiment explores how current fossil-era electricity prices already produce Renewable Pull-like pressures. In 2019, industrial electricity prices in Germany averaged about forty euros per megawatt-hour, similar to those in the United States. By 2023, German prices exceeded one hundred, while U.S. prices remained below fifty. Applied to the Renewable Pull equation, this gap yields a theoretical pull factor of nearly one, indicating that imported products could undercut domestic ones by half. In other words, the economic force that will shape the renewable future is already visible today, merely driven by fossil fuel volatility rather than solar and wind economics.
Policy responses can modify but not abolish the Renewable Pull. Tariffs and subsidies operate as direct counterweights: a fifteen-percent tariff offsets a pull of 0.18, thirty percent offsets 0.43, and fifty percent cancels a full unit. Yet protectionism merely delays adaptation and risks retaliation. A more durable strategy lies in infrastructure and finance. Cross-border hydrogen pipelines, shared storage facilities, and coordinated import corridors can distribute renewable advantages without forcing full relocation of industry. Likewise, credit guarantees and multilateral financing mechanisms can equalize capital costs, softening the gradient that drives the pull.
At the sectoral level, policy differentiation is essential. The Renewable Pull concentrates in sectors where energy constitutes a large share of production cost and where transport is inexpensive. For chemicals and steel, mitigation efforts should prioritize energy-price stabilization and intermediate imports. For cement and other bulk minerals, domestic production remains viable but will require investment in carbon capture to meet climate goals. Tailored strategies prevent inefficient subsidy dispersion and focus resources where the pull truly threatens competitiveness.
The broader economic implications are profound. As renewable capacity expands, industrial geography may reorganize around corridors of cheap, stable, and financeable energy. Regions with excellent solar and wind potential, political stability, and access to capital—parts of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the American Midwest—could become new manufacturing hubs.
