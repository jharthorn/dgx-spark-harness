In the transition toward a renewable-powered global economy, industrial competitiveness increasingly depends on spatial variations in renewable energy potentials, storage capacities, and capital costs. he study Which Top Energy-Intensive Manufacturing Countries Can Compete in a Renewable Energy Future? introduces the concept of the Renewable Pull—an economic force that could lead to the relocation of energy-intensive industries toward countries with lower renewable-based production costs.
The analysis addresses a fundamental question: Can today’s top manufacturing nations remain competitive in an energy future dominated by variable renewables? Using detailed energy system modeling, Burdack et al. evaluate ten leading manufacturing economies—China, India, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Iran—by embedding industrial production directly into each country’s optimized renewable power system. The integrated modeling approach ensures that industry and domestic electricity demand compete for the same renewable resources, generating a realistic representation of national energy system interactions.
The concept of Renewable Pull is mathematically defined as the relative cost advantage of importing energy-intensive goods over producing them domestically. A positive Renewable Pull indicates that imports are cheaper, creating an incentive for relocation. By combining hourly-resolved renewable potentials, national discount rates, salt cavern storage availability, and shipping route data across 150 coastal nations, the authors compute Renewable Pull factors for 1,450 export–import pairs. The study focuses on four cornerstone commodities—olefins, ammonia, steel, and cement—which together represent the backbone of global industrial energy use.
Results reveal that nine out of ten top manufacturing countries experience a Renewable Pull under uniform capital cost assumptions. The magnitude depends strongly on both process energy intensity and transport cost share. Olefin and ammonia production, with high electricity demand and low shipping sensitivity, are most vulnerable; cement, with high bulk transport costs, shows virtually no Renewable Pull except in isolated cases such as Saudi Arabia, where raw material prices distort cost balance.
Spatially, the Renewable Pull aligns with global renewable resource gradients. High solar irradiance and favorable wind patterns in North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of South America generate strong cost advantages relative to East Asia and Europe. Japan and South Korea face the highest Renewable Pull values due to limited land availability and the absence of salt cavern hydrogen storage. Germany’s constrained onshore wind and moderate solar resources place it in a similar position, though with smaller magnitude.
When national capital costs are incorporated—reflecting country-specific investment risk and natural hazard exposure—the hierarchy changes dramatically. Germany’s Renewable Pull drops by a factor of six, positioning it as the second least-affected nation after Saudi Arabia. Conversely, Iran and India, burdened by higher financing costs and hazard risk, experience amplified Renewable Pull effects despite strong renewable resources. The study emphasizes that financial parameters can outweigh purely physical energy system differences, underscoring the sensitivity of industrial competitiveness to macroeconomic stability.
For Germany, detailed countermeasure analysis demonstrates that targeted imports of hydrogen, methanol, and hot briquetted iron (HBI) from within the EU can nearly eliminate the Renewable Pull. Using an EU-wide import optimization model, the researchers find that truck and pipeline logistics provide lower-cost supply chains than global maritime routes. Hydrogen imports replicate today’s fossil energy dependency but preserve domestic value creation in downstream sectors; methanol and HBI imports shift some value addition abroad yet maintain strategic control of high-value processing such as chemical synthesis and steel finishing.
The implications extend beyond Europe. For the United States, 41 countries exert a Renewable Pull, mainly across North and West Africa and parts of the Middle East. China faces the most extensive exposure, with up to 72 countries exerting measurable pull effects, while India experiences the highest absolute intensity, exceeding a factor of two between domestic and import costs. These distributions indicate that the Renewable Pull is a truly global phenomenon, reshaping the geography of heavy industry in a decarbonized world.
Methodologically, the study’s novelty lies in coupling process-level industrial modeling with integrated energy system optimization under a unified framework (ETHOS.FINE). Each national model includes hourly renewable generation time series, clustered solar and wind potential data, storage constraints, and capital cost heterogeneity. Shipping and import costs are computed via a dedicated route simulation tool incorporating vessel investment, port fees, insurance, and canal tolls. This holistic approach enables direct comparison between domestic and import-based production under consistent assumptions, avoiding sectoral bias.
Discussion of sensitivity factors highlights four dominant determinants of the Renewable Pull: (1) renewable potential quality, (2) availability of large-scale storage such as salt caverns, (3) national capital costs, and (4) transportation logistics. Among these, capital cost assumptions exert the strongest leverage on competitiveness. Converging discount rates across regions could invert relative positions—benefiting nations such as Iran, India, and Brazil, while eroding Germany’s current advantage. Conversely, rising capital costs due to market volatility or hazard risk could intensify the Renewable Pull on developing economies.
The authors further relate Renewable Pull values to contemporary electricity price differentials. A simplified analysis using 2019–2023 industrial power prices shows that fossil-based price gaps already create pull effects larger than those predicted for renewable scenarios. For instance, Germany’s 2023 industrial electricity cost—over 100 EUR/MWh compared with 44–49 EUR/MWh in the U.S.—corresponds to a theoretical pull factor > 0.9, suggesting that fossil-era price disparities already mirror the future renewable-driven relocation pressures.
Policy discussion acknowledges that tariffs and subsidies can counterbalance the Renewable Pull: a 15 % import tariff offsets roughly 0.18 in pull factor, while 50 % neutralizes about 1. However, the study argues that strategic infrastructure—particularly for hydrogen and intermediate imports—offers a more sustainable response than protectionism. By coupling domestic renewable expansion with coordinated import corridors, nations can relieve system pressure, stabilize electricity prices, and maintain industrial value chains.
In conclusion, the Renewable Pull is both an analytical metric and a policy signal. It quantifies how differential renewable energy economics may drive industrial relocation in a net-zero world. The results confirm that nine of ten major manufacturing economies face exposure, with severity dictated by the interplay of resource endowment, capital cost, and logistics. Imports of hydrogen, methanol, and HBI emerge as powerful mitigation levers, particularly for high-cost, densely populated regions. For policymakers, the message is clear: competitiveness in a renewable-energy future will hinge as much on capital accessibility and infrastructure integration as on sunlight and wind speed.
